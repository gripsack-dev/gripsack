# verification/reports — archived runner logs (2026-09-24)

Unmodified copies of the gate logs captured on 2026-09-24 in `/tmp/gripsack-baseline/`
(pristine-worktree baseline runs) and `/tmp/gripsack-a0/` (A0-tree runs), archived
2026-09-24. Every copy is byte-identical to its source (SHA-256 below, verified after
copy). `2026-09-24-baseline-verify.log` contains carriage-return progress bytes; the
archive preserves them exactly.

## Binding statement (honest limits)

- File mtimes (2026-09-24 08:14–08:56 BST = 07:14–07:56 UTC) are consistent with the
  run windows recorded in plan/0049-handover-bundle-import.md (baseline gates
  07:14–07:35 UTC at pristine `176eaecd85a95b4f29ed49293a889c7bf16cc8c8`; A0-tree gates
  07:36–07:56 UTC).
- The source-commit attribution itself is attested only by plan/0049 prose. The exact
  source revision and dirty-tree identity of each run is **not independently
  recoverable** from these logs (they carry no commit marker), and several logs show
  BuildKit **CACHED** test layers rather than fresh execution (see observations).
- Therefore these logs are retained as historical runner observations. They do NOT
  satisfy the hardened runner-evidence contract (repo-local report + SHA-256 +
  executed/passed/failed/skipped counts + observed marker + tool versions/inputs +
  exact source commit/dirty identity) and MUST NOT be cited as `verified` evidence
  without a fresh source-bound rerun.

Note: the earlier G-03 ledger record's handwritten `obligations.checked: 50` does not
match either verify log; both show `56 verified, 0 errors`. The logs are the
authoritative observation.
